In the beginning of August 2021 [1729](https://1729.com) raised an interesting task: "Build a censorship-resistant inflation dashboard" [^1].

Soon Matthew Fontana from [Steamr](https://streamr.network/) pitched in another USD 50K if one were to use their tech in addition to Chainlink. This brings the total potential reward to a total of 150k USD in $DATA and $LINK.

I came up with the idea to individually capture price points using a simple smartphone app similar to what [Premise](https://premise.com) is doing - in a decentralized manner, whithout relying on one entity.

Unfortunately I am unable to alocate the time at the moment. I do not think I would be able to meet their deadline in November.
