The goal was to configure a proper WLAN access point that I attached via Ethernet. To perform the necessary configuration I had to connect to the device via Ethernet as well.
My only available computer was a Windows 10 Tablet without a dedicated Ethernet port. Luckily I remembered my old Apple USB Ethernet Adapter that I had laying around somewhere.
The issue was that Windows does not have drivers for this device. It is not officially supported. Luckily thanks to the Internet I was able to learn that the chip was manufactured by a company called &amp;amp;ldquo;Asix&amp;amp;rdquo;.
On this page the driver can be found: https://www.asix.com.tw/en/product/USBEthernet/High-Speed_USB_Ethernet/AX88772C. The rest of the instructions from this post on StackExchange worked as described.
Also I learned that Apple still sells the adapter for $29 - 100Mb in 2021!</content:encoded></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://blog.philippnagel.com/search/</link><guid>https://blog.philippnagel.com/search/</guid><description/><content:encoded></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
